He took his time scanning the busy establishment, looking for any signs of suspicious activity. His excessive caution was not instinctive, but merely a formality imposed on him by his work. In the corner of his eye, he noticed a young female barista working behind the counter. He proceeded to sauntered up to the counter. With a playful smile on his face he ordered his coffee. Awaiting his spicy iced latte, he stole glances at his phone, keeping an eye on the screen. His attention was soon diverted, however, as the female barista smiled at him and asked if there was anything else she could get for him.

"Oh, just your number," Felix quipped, flashing his most charming smile.
The barista chuckled, but shook her head. "Sorry, I'm taken."

Lynleit curiously observed Felix from a distance, as he was making a fool of himself at the counter. She couldn't believe how little regard he had for the seriousness of his job.`;
